# Thrift Crowd Staking - Technical Guide

## Architecture Overview
Thrift Crowd Staking is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Cardano blockchain. It consists of three main components:
1. Smart Contracts (Plutus)
2. Backend API (Haskell)
3. Frontend (React)

## Smart Contracts
- Language: Plutus (Haskell-based)
- Key Files: 
  - smart-contracts/src/CSGContract.hs
  - smart-contracts/test/CSGContractSpec.hs

### Key Functions:
- alidateCSG: Main validator function for CSG operations
- alidateJoin: Validates joining a CSG
- alidateClaimReward: Validates reward claims
- alidateEndCycle: Validates ending a CSG cycle

### Deployment:
- Use Cardano CLI for contract compilation and deployment
- Store contract address securely for backend integration

## Backend API
- Language: Haskell
- Framework: Servant
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Key Files:
  - ackend/src/Main.hs
  - ackend/src/CSG.hs
  - ackend/src/API.hs

### API Endpoints:
- POST /csg/create
- POST /csg/join/{csgId}
- POST /csg/claim/{csgId}
- POST /csg/end/{csgId}
- GET /csg/list
- GET /csg/{csgId}

### Key Components:
- CSG Management: Handling CSG creation, joining, and lifecycle
- Blockchain Interaction: Integrating with Cardano node for contract interactions
- User Authentication: JWT-based authentication system
- Database Operations: CRUD operations for CSGs and user data

## Frontend
- Framework: React
- State Management: Redux
- Key Files:
  - rontend/src/App.js
  - rontend/src/components/*.js
  - rontend/src/api/api.js

### Key Components:
- Home: Dashboard displaying active CSGs and user balance
- CreateCSG: Form for creating new CSGs
- JoinCSG: Interface for browsing and joining existing CSGs
- CSGDetails: Detailed view of a specific CSG with participant info

## Development Setup
1. Smart Contracts:
   - Install Cardano development environment (node, cli, etc.)
   - Use cabal build to compile contracts
   - Use Plutus Playground for initial testing

2. Backend:
   - Install Haskell and Stack
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Run stack build to compile
   - Use stack run to start the server

3. Frontend:
   - Install Node.js and npm
   - Run 
pm install in the frontend directory
   - Use 
pm start to run the development server

## Deployment
- Smart Contracts: Deploy to Cardano testnet/mainnet using Cardano CLI
- Backend: Deploy to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud)
  - Use Docker for containerization
  - Set up auto-scaling for high availability
- Frontend: Deploy to a CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront)
- Database: Use a managed PostgreSQL service (e.g., AWS RDS)

## Testing
- Smart Contracts: Use Plutus Playground and property-based testing
- Backend: Use HSpec for unit testing, integration tests with mock blockchain
- Frontend: Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
- End-to-end testing: Use Cypress for full application flow testing

## Security Considerations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization using JWT
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Regularly audit smart contracts for vulnerabilities
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Monitoring and Logging
- Use ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging
- Implement Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring
- Set up alerts for critical system events and errors

## Scalability
- Implement caching layer (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data
- Use load balancing for backend services
- Optimize database queries and implement indexing
- Consider sharding for database scalability

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Implement staging environment for pre-production testing
- Use blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates

## Backup and Disaster Recovery
- Regular database backups
- Implement multi-region redundancy for critical services
- Develop and test disaster recovery plan

## Documentation
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation (e.g., using Swagger)
- Document all major components and their interactions
- Keep a changelog for tracking system changes and updates
